## Project Description:

This project was built mainly with `Html5` and `Bootstrap CSS`, it has the ability to generate a random password that has a combination of uppercase and lowercase alphabets, number and symbols to make up a strong password for it's users, and then display the generated password in an alert box.
This project is just a side project I developed just to improve my knowledge of basic `JavaScript`. I would also like to get your feedback about this project, you can email your feedback to me to info.nath01@gmail.com .
